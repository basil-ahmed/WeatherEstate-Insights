## Ethical Considerations for Web Scraping from Property Finder

This document outlines how this project adheres to ethical guidelines and practices for scraping data from websites, specifically Property Finder, while complying with the site's policies and broader ethical standards in web scraping.

### 1. **Compliance with `robots.txt`**

   - Property Finder’s [robots.txt](https://www.propertyfinder.ae/robots.txt) file contains specific instructions on which sections of the website are permitted or restricted for automated scraping or crawling.
   - Key sections of the `robots.txt` file, such as `Disallow: /`, indicate that most of their pages are restricted from being crawled by web scraping tools. This means that scraping data from Property Finder without explicit permission would violate their guidelines and could potentially lead to legal issues or account restrictions.
   - **Action**: As per the site's `robots.txt` file, no scraping of data should be done from Property Finder without explicit permission from the site administrators. This project will cease any further scraping from this website to comply with their stated policies.


### 2. **Legal Compliance**

   Scraping must always adhere to the site's terms of service and applicable legal regulations:
   
   - **Action Taken**: Upon reviewing Property Finder's terms of service and robots.txt file, the project ceases any further scraping activity on Property Finder to avoid any violation of their terms or legal issues related to unauthorized data access. Future scraping or data collection will only occur if permission is obtained or an official API is used.

### 3. **Respecting Website Ownership and Server Load**

   Websites invest significant resources in their infrastructure, and excessive or unauthorized scraping can negatively impact server performance:
   
   - **Action Taken**: This project includes rate-limiting mechanisms such as `time.sleep(2)` between requests to avoid putting a strain on the server. However, as scraping is disallowed by Property Finder’s `robots.txt`, this functionality will not be used until explicit permission or alternative data access methods are obtained. In the future, scraping would be done in a manner that minimizes server load and respects rate-limiting.

### 4. **Data Privacy and Security**

   When scraping public data, it is crucial to avoid collecting sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII):
   
   - **Action Taken**: The code is designed to collect only public, non-sensitive data such as property listings (price, location, bedrooms, area, etc.). However, since scraping is not allowed by Property Finder, no data, including non-PII, will be collected without permission. This ensures user privacy is maintained, and no sensitive data is unintentionally harvested.

### 5. **Transparency and Accountability**

   The purpose of this project is to gather public property listing data for analysis and research purposes, combining it with weather data to create meaningful insights. It is essential to be transparent about the reasons for data collection:
   
   - **Action Taken**: The project openly discloses its goal of combining public real estate data with weather information for analytical purposes. However, in light of the prohibition outlined in Property Finder’s robots.txt, the project has halted scraping activities to ensure compliance and will only proceed once authorized data access is granted.

### 6. **Alternatives to Scraping**

   Instead of scraping, websites often provide APIs or data-sharing agreements that allow ethical access to data:
   
   - **Action Taken**: Before proceeding with scraping, alternatives such as the use of Property Finder’s official API (if available) or requesting permission from the website will be pursued. If an API is found, the code will be adapted to access the data in a compliant and ethical manner.

### 7. **Respecting Property Finder's Policies**

   Property Finder's `robots.txt` clearly states that scraping the entire site is disallowed. In acknowledgment of this:
   
   - **Action Taken**: This project respects Property Finder’s stated policies, and no further attempts to scrape the website will be made. The code has been modified to reflect compliance with their `robots.txt` file, and any future data collection will follow their guidelines.

### 8. **Rate Limiting and Server Load Management**

   The project implements rate-limiting measures to ensure that, if scraping were allowed or done elsewhere, the website servers would not be overwhelmed:
   
   - **Action Taken**: While the current project no longer scrapes Property Finder, any future scraping activities on permitted sites will include respectful rate-limiting strategies, such as the current 2-second delay between requests (`time.sleep(2)`).

---

**Conclusion**: This project complies with ethical web scraping guidelines by ceasing scraping activities on Property Finder due to restrictions in their `robots.txt` file. Future data collection efforts will focus on obtaining permission or using an official API if provided. The project strives to maintain ethical and responsible behavior when accessing and using online data.
